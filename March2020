<h2>Latest brainlife.io news</h2>

<h3>Franco Pestilli awarded prestigious Microsoft Investigator Fellowship to advance brainlife.io</h3>
<p>
Brainlife.io Project Director <a href="https://brainlife.github.io/plab/l">Franco Pestilli</a> was selected as one of 15 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-investigator-fellows-accelerate-scientific-and-teaching-impact-with-azure-cloud-computing/">Microsoft Investigator Fellows</a> among 290 applicants. This fellowship will empower the brainlife.io team with Microsoft Azure resources, as well as provide $200,000 in support across two years, to advance the platform.

<h3>Preprint out for a segmentation tool integrated within brainlife.io</h3>
<p>
While automatic segmentation methods have improved, they still aren‚Äôt high quality, especially when it comes to datasets with diverse characteristics. Classifyber, developed by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giulia_Berto"> Giulia Bert√≤</a> and a team of close collaborators, solves this. Classifyber is a supervised streamline-based app that performs automatic bundle segmentation by learning from example bundles that are already segmented.
</p>

<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.942714v1">Read the preprint now.</a>

<p>
There are two briainlife.io apps connected with the preprint:
<p>
    
<h4>Classifyber</h4>
<p>This app is based on binary linear classification, which simultaneously combines information from bundle geometries, connectivity patterns, and atlases. Plus, it can deal with different bundle sizes, tracking algorithms, and dMRI data qualities.
</p>    

<a href="https://brainlife.io/app/5d6fcae439867216d8496442">Try the app</a>

<h4>Classifyber - segmentation</h4>
<p>This app implements only the test phase of Classifyber and runs Classifyber as a pre-trained bundle segmentation method.
