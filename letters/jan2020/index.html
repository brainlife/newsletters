Welcome to the brainlife.io newsletter!
</p>

<p>
We will use this newsletter to share the evolving story of our open neuroscience platform with you and keep you informed of any major changes or updates that could benefit your work. Read on to learn more about some members of our brainlife community and the latest additions to the platform.
</p>

<h2>Featured users</h2>

<p>
brainlife.io has a broad range of users at different stages of their brainlife journey. We are working to build a stronger community on the platform, where users can collaborate on projects, reproduce each others' work, and communicate openly about their goals.
</p>


<p>
Check out a few of the many users in the brainlife community, including some who have joined in recent months.
</p>

<h3>üßë Alexis Porter</h3>
<h4>
Graduate student in psychology, Northwestern University
</h4>
<p>
Alexis was looking for ways to efficiently handle batch processing of neuroimaging data without having to worry about storage issues or slowing down local systems and is finding the pipelines useful but is still in the early stages of designing next steps for preprocessing.
</p>

<h3>üßë Alice Quiao</h3>
<h4>
PhD student in social psychology, University of Southern California
</h4>
<p>
New to neuroimaging, Alice used brainlife.io to practice resting state analyses using FSL and to find instructions on setting up fMRI parameters for a class project. Alice hopes to one day host a study using fMRI.
</p>

<h3>üßë Elouise Koops</h3>
<h4>PhD student in audiology & neuroscience, University Medical Center Groningen</h4>
<p>
Elouise found out about the platform two years ago in class when brainlife.io's Franco Pestilli presented it. Elouise has already processed data in a manner similar to an AFQ but wanted to see if the data processing results would differ on brainlife.io's server.
</p>

<h3>üßë Shubhom Bhattacharya</h3>
<h4>Graduate student in engineering, Cornell University</h4>
<p>
Shubhom is using ds000171 and brainlife.io's image preprocessing service to look at fMRI scans of depressed patients and evaluate various deep learning algorithms' effectiveness in diagnosing these scans, potentially establishing some "symptoms" of depression.

<h2>New Features</h2>

<h3>Datasets</h3>
<p>
The Datasets feature was developed as part of a new project in collaboration with <a href="https://www.datalad.org">DataLad</a>. brainlife.io‚Äôs Datasets feature allows users to select and import the DataLad datasets they need from our list. There are more than 300 datasets that can be imported using this feature!

<h2>New App</h2>

<h3>Segment tractogram in to fiber categories</h3>
<p>
Do you have tractography that you want to do a quick quality check on? Maybe you want to see if there are biologically implausible streamlines in your whole brain tractogram or if there‚Äôs a segmentation failing to find a tract of interest. This app categorizes each streamline in your tractography model according to the regions it connects (i.e. fronto-parietal), giving you a window into your data. A quick look at the relative proportions of the output categories can help you determine if your tractography has sufficient quality and if your tract of interest is likely to be found.
</p>

<h3>fMRIPrep</h3>
<p>
fMRIPrep is a collection of state-of-the-art functional MRI processing pipelines developed by Stanford's <a href="https://poldracklab.stanford.edu">Poldrack Lab.</a> This toolbox will preprocess functional data through routines for brain extraction and motion estimation, while correcting for geometric distortions and slice timing and aligning to a number of standard output spaces. We've incorporated this powerful processing stream into brainlife.io so you can obtain preprocessed fMRI data. After running this app, you'll have access to cleaned-up functional data for use in your downstream statistical analyses.
</p>

<h2>New Publication</h2>

<h3>Human white matter microstructure predicts elite sports participation</h3>

<p>
Brad Caron, a brainlife.io developer and PhD student at Indiana University Bloomington, has published his first preprint, ‚ÄúHuman white matter microstructure predicts elite sports participation.‚Äù Caron's team performed their analyses on brainlife.io and released the code and data derivatives there for others to replicate.

<h2>Other news</h2>

<h3>Spring 2020 Neuroscience Lab at IU will feature brainlife.io</h3>
<p>
The Lab in Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience course at Indiana University Bloomington will provide practical experience with magnetic resonance imaging and data acquisition, organization, and preprocessing. Students will learn how to manage a complete scientific workflow for neuroimaging research, both by collecting their own data at IU‚Äôs Imaging Research Facility and processing the data using brainlife.io.
</p>

<p>
<a href="mailto:franpest@indiana.edu">Dr. Franco Pestilli</a> and Brad Caron will teach this course.
</p>

<h3>Have you tried OSG Connect?</h3>
<p>
This cyberinfrastructure connects clusters from different research centers by scraping together unused computing cycles, so jobs get sent wherever there is a free computing cycle to use. Using OSG is free and frees up space on other clusters!
