<p>
Welcome to the brainlife.io newsletter!
</p>

<p>
We will use this newsletter to share the evolving story of our open neuroscience platform with you and keep you informed of any major changes or updates that could benefit your work. Read on to learn more about some members of our brainlife community and learn about the latest additions to the platform.
</p>

<h2>Featured users</h2>

<p>
brainlife.io has a broad range of users at different stages of their brainlife journey. We are working to build a stronger community on the platform, where users can collaborate on projects, reproduce each others' work, and communicate openly about their goals.
</p>


<p>
Check out a few of the many users in the brainlife community, including some who have joined in recent months.
</p>

<h3>üßë Alexis Porter</h3>
<h4>
Graduate student in psychology, Northwestern University
</h4>
<p>
Alexis was looking for ways to efficiently handle batch processing of neuroimaging data without having to worry about storage issues or slowing down local systems. She's finding the pipelines useful but is still in the early stages of designing the next steps for preprocessing.
</p>

<h3>üßë Alice Quiao</h3>
<h4>
PhD student in social psychology, University of Southern California
</h4>
<p>
New to neuroimaging, Alice used brainlife.io to help her practice resting state analyses using FSL and to find instructions on setting up fMRI parameters for her class project. Although new to brain imaging, Alice hopes to one day host her own study using fMRI.
</p>

<h3>üßë Elouise Koops</h3>
<h4>PhD student in audiology & neuroscience, University Medical Center Groningen</h4>
<p>
Elouise found out about the platform two years ago when brainlife.io's Franco Pestilli presented it to her class. Since she's already processed her data in a manner similar to an AFQ, but coded locally, she wanted to see if the data processing results would differ on brainlife.io's server.
</p>

<h3>üßë Shubhom Bhattacharya</h3>
<h4>Graduate student in engineering, Cornell University</h4>
<p>
Shubhom is using ds000171 to look at fMRI scans of depressed patients and evaluating various deep learning algorithms' effectiveness in diagnosing these scans, potentially establishing some "symptoms" of depression. He is using brainlife.io's image preprocessing service to do this.

<h2>New Features</h2>

<h3>Datasets</h3>
<p>
A new feature has been developed as part of recently started project in collaboration with DataLad. brainlife.io‚Äôs Datasets feature allows users to select and import the DataLad datasets they need from our list. There are more than 300 datasets that can be imported using this new feature!
</p>

<h2>New App</h2>

<h3>Segment tractogram in to fiber categories</h3>
<p>
Do you have tractography that you'd like to do a quick quality check on? Perhaps you want to see if there are biologically implausible streamlines in your whole brain tractogram or if there‚Äôs a segmentation failing to find a tract of interest. This app categorizes each streamline in your tractography model according to the regions it connects (i.e. fronto-parietal), giving you a window into your data. A quick look at the relative proportions of the output categories can help you determine if your tractography has sufficient quality and if your tract of interest is likely to be found.
</p>

<h3>fMRIPrep</h3>
<p>
This app runs fMRIPrep on the brainlife.io interface. Its pipelines process T1w, T2w, fMRI, and fieldmaps by calling a series of functions from FSL, FreeSurfer, ANTs, and nipy. It applies these tools in a principled way designed to handle common imaging artifacts and biases, and it outputs processed anatomical and functional images for further analysis. // why do you need to preprocess to begin with -- imaging who‚Äôs going to be reading this -- those data needs to be cleaned and realined even though FRMI is the best mode of processing mri data -- segue into why they need preprcoessing and why to do it on brainlife and then how it works
</p>

<p>
Please note, this app is in beta and it needs testers.

<h2>New Publication</h2>

<h3>Human white matter microstructure predicts elite sports participation</h3>

<p>
Bradley Caron, a brainlife.io developer and graduate student at Indiana University Bloomington, has published his first preprint, ‚ÄúHuman white matter microstructure predicts elite sports participation.‚Äù Caron and his team performed their analyses on brainlife.io and released the code and data derivatives there for others to replicate.

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3>Spring 2020 Neuroscience Lab at IU will feature brainlife.io</h3>
<p>
The Lab in Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience course at Indiana University Bloomington will provide practical experience with magnetic resonance imaging and data acquisition, organization, and preprocessing. Students will learn how to manage a complete scientific workflow for neuroimaging research, both by collecting their own data at IU‚Äôs Imaging Research Facility and processing the data using brainlife.io.
</p>

<p>
<a href="mailto:franpest@indiana.edu">Dr. Franco Pestilli</a> and Bradley Caron will teach this course.
</p>

<h3>Have you tried OSG Connect?</h3>
<p>
This cyberinfrastructure connects clusters from different research centers by scraping together unused computing cycles, so jobs get sent wherever there is a free computing cycle to use. Using OSG is free and frees up space on other clusters!

<h3>Questions or news to share?</h3>
<p>
Don't forget, if you run into any trouble on brainlife.io or want to ask a question about the platform, message Soichi Hayashi (@hayashis) or Stephanie Hernandez McGavin (@Steph) on Slack.
</p>

<p>
You can also <a href="mailto:brlife@iu.edu">contact us</a> with any announcements you'd like shared in future newsletters, including about your contributions to brainlife.io, any work you've published using brainlife.io, or even your major wins with the platform.
